## ABSTRACT:

Automated pet feeder is a product that would replace manual feeding method which
can be set at a required feeding amount and feeding time. Innovation of pet feeder is used to
overcome forgetful of the pet owner to feed their pet and to avoid extra spending expenses by
leaving them at a pet hotel. The objective of this project is to design and develop a mechanism
for pet feeder. In this project, Arduino is used as the microcontroller to control the mechanism
and to operate the system with a given of set time. Finite element analysis is used to analyze the
maximum stress that the designed mechanism can withstand. Furthermore prototype testing on
the mechanism with experimental and theoretical was conducted, the result of the analysis is
analyzed. The analysis is providing the path to make sure the final concept of the pet feeder is
reached.
