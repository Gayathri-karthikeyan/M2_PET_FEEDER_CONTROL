# **PET FEEDER CONTROL**

## INTRODUCTION:

Pet is good accompany partner to human. It helps to reduce the stress from living life style and as a precaution to keep away burglars . Nowadays, pet treats as one part of the family member. Therefore,healthy level of the pet need to consider and focus on balance diet.In additional to that, pet doesnâ€™t have ability to get the food itself, and it has to depend on the pet owner to feed them. Therefore,Automated Pet Feeder is created and used to solve the problems feeding the pet on time with required portion.

Automated pet feeder is started popular among the choices of pet owner used to replace the traditional feeding method. The product brings convenience to pet owner by setting the feeding time and portion of the food, which it helps to make sure the pet receives the required diet through a day. The automated pet feeder trains the pet how to consume food properly and consume at certain time. The result of using pet feeder is the pet will receive their diet and pet owner can be no worry about feeding their pet.


## OBJECTIVES:

Objective of doing this research is to design and develop a mechanism for automated pet feeder which able to give appropriate portion of pet food on a given set time.


## COMPONENTS:

* ATmega328

* Servo Motor

* Push Button

* 10k ohm Resistor

* 270 ohm Resistor +3

* LED +3

* 5V Power Supply


## PROPOSED METHOD:

The system that design is the automated pet feeder able to adjust the main criteria. By pressing push button, the user is able to adjust the real time based on the time when they start to use.That means the user can set the feeding time one hour once or two hour once and etc...Based on the how old the pet is.One period means that the rectangular rack with measuring cup moved forward and backward. Forward action means that move the pet food drop to pet bowl, the backward action of rectangular rack also known as the original position of the rectangular rack which is the filled the measuring cup with the pet food.


## BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS:

## ATmega328:

The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller created by Atmel in the megaAVR family (later Microchip Technology acquired Atmel in 2016). It has a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC processor core.The Atmel 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general-purpose I/O lines, 32 general-purpose working registers, 3 flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and 5 software-selectable power-saving modes. The device operates between 1.8 and 5.5 volts. The device achieves throughput approaching 1 MIPS/MHz.ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed. Perhaps the most common implementation of this chip is on the popular Arduino development platform, namely the Arduino Uno, Arduino Pro Mini and Arduino Nano models.

## SERVO MOTOR:

A servomotor (or servo motor) is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration.[1] It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors.

Servomotors are not a specific class of motor, although the term servomotor is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a closed-loop control system.

Servomotors are used in applications such as robotics, CNC machinery, and automated manufacturing.

## PUSH BUTTON:

A push button switch controls an action in a machine or other type of process.

Most push button switches function in the same way. Pressure is placed on the button or actuator, resulting in the depression of the internal spring and contacts and the touching of stable contacts at the bottom of the switch. This process will either close or open the electrical circuit. The repeat application of pressure will cause the spring to retract and alter the status of the push button connection.

You can choose between push buttons featuring normally open or closed contacts, which change state upon actuation. Continual pressure must be maintained on the button of a momentary switch to prompt the action. However, it will remain in a stable state within a latching push button until pressure is reapplied.

## RESISTOR:

A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. 

## LED:

The LED is a special type of diode and they have similar electrical characteristics to a PN junction diode. Hence the LED allows the flow of current in the forward direction and blocks the current in the reverse direction. The LED occupies a small area which is less than 1 mm2. The applications of LEDs used to make various electrical and electronic projects.

The light-emitting diode simply, we know as a diode. When the diode is forward biased, then the electrons & holes are moving fast across the junction and they are combined constantly, removing one another out. Soon after the electrons are moving from the n-type to the p-type silicon, it combines with the holes, then it disappears. Hence it makes the complete atom & more stable and it gives the little burst of energy in the form of a tiny packet or photon of light.

## POWER SUPPLY:

A voltage source is a two-terminal device which can maintain a fixed voltage.[1] An ideal voltage source can maintain the fixed voltage independent of the load resistance or the output current. However, a real-world voltage source cannot supply unlimited current.A voltage source is the dual of a current source.

## ADVANTAGES:

* You can schedule multiple meals in advance. 

* They can be used for dry and wet food. 

* They'll improve your relationship with your pets. 

* They support good health. 

* Unit is easy to set-up, program and operate.

* The unit is designed to deliver meals one hour once or two hour once and etc...


## DISADVANTAGES:

* If you have cats that are too confident with their raiding skills and they tend to steal food ahead of schedule.

* Need to check the food availability.

* Difficult to monitor the pet consume the food at the schedules time.


## CONCLUSION:

The automated pet feeder can be adjusted the feeding time and the motor can rotate according to the required time.This project brought together several components and ideas to achieve a common goal that is design an automated pet feeder using ATmega328.

The key components of the project include a push button it is used to set the time whether the food should drop one hour once or two hour once and it has different time cycles and a servo motor which will be programmed to serve the food accoding to the user setup time using push button.It relieves the owner from having to feed his pet multiple times a day. The proposed project automatically serve the food according to the time setup.

The owner does not have to worry about making plans or feeding his pet because of this automated pet feeder.This automatic pet feeder serves as a helping hand as it works efficiently in the absence of the owner.
